# Rule Clarifications and Changes

A collection of rule clarifications from the community or the designer,
and rule changes the designer had intended the game, or would change given
the chance

## All-around
- WOULD CHANGE: Tiles go back onto the spot they came from
- CLARIFICATION: Tiles know which location they came from if they ever need to
- WOULD CHANGE: If the terrain of your card is full, instead of drawing a new card, place on any space eligible for building, and adjacent if possible
- CLARIFICATION: If ever during your turn, the terrain of your card is full - explicitly after your mandatory action - draw a new card.

## Base Game
- Miners: Pieces ON Mountains do not score for Miners, no matter how they get there

## Nomads
- Quarry tokens ARE limited to 25
- You do not lose a Nomad tile if you move away from the location that gave it
- Sword cannot cancel the end of game
- WOULD CHANGE: Sword does cancel end of game because end of game only checks at the end of a round
- Resettlement, Wagon, and Lighthouse DO allow you to pick up Nomad tiles en route
- Caravan does NOT allow you to pick up Nomad tiles en route - it is a single move

## Crossroads
o DXV calls the Warrior, Ship, and Wagon tokens "Meeples"
- Warriors DO NOT prevent moving away from their area
- Fort draws a card and places there - if no spaces are empty, you do not place
- Single water and mountain hexes DO qualify for the Home Country task
- Caravan and Resettlement (from Nomads) CAN move a Warrior
- Meeples stay on the board if you lose the corresponding tile
- Meeples do not change end of game
- Fort draws a card, then builds on that terrain; that build CAN be modified by Outpost from Nomads
- City Hall counts EACH settlement for Shepherd
- If you lose the Crossroads tile, you do not immediately discard a Terrain card
- You choose which terrain card to use when you do an action that requires a terrain card
- DXV HOUSE RULE: If you draw identical terrain cards with Crossroads, you may choose any terrain
- DXV HOUSE RULE: Meeples can ONLY be moved by their own abilities

## Marshland
- Canoe actions interrupt normal play
  - If a Canoe action empties a location, the first action chain is again interrupted so if A triggers B and C, but B triggers C and A, then the (reacting) actions go (B, (C, A), C)
- Since the Canoe action is done as a reaction, you CAN use it the turn in which you acquire it if another player empties a location during your turn (say, by their use of Canoe)
- Canoe goes 1) choose terrain, 2) build settlement
- Temple pieces built DURING your mandatory action are NOT part of the mandatory action, so for example, do not effect Families
- If you build 2 in Marshland, you cannot score Families
- Fountain Bonus tile does not modify Fountain until the turn after it is acquired
- For Canoe (and everything else), tile reset is done at the start of each player's turn - WOULD CHANGE tile reset is done at the end of each player's turn
- Settlements set aside by Temple are played the next turn even if the Temple tile is lost
- Settlements set aside by Temple CAN delay the end of game

## Harvest
- Bazaar CAN be used to repeat the Crossroads tile action to draw a 3rd card for your next turn
- Rovers do not score for building on the Island
- Silo actions at end of game are done in Player order, with each player performing all desired actions
- Scouts do count as YOUR settlements, so they work for Tavern
- You CAN claim Mayor-of-a-line WHILE moving a Meeple or a Settlement (say, via Resettlement)
- Silo builds do NOT score for Rovers
- UNCLEAR: Scouts either ARE or ARE NOT "your own" settlements - I like that they ARE, especially because the 2nd one doesn't have to be adjacent to your own "real" settlement

## Queenies

### Capitol

### Caves
- WOULD CHANGE: Caves are placed on the first (across then down) mountain hex not within 2 of a location
- WOULD CHANGE: Use only with Tavern board
- Caves ARE (still?) mountain hexes
- Pieces ON a Cave are not adjacent to a Cave

### Island
- The coast spaces are adjacent to water spaces
- The surrounding water is NOT made of spaces, so no tokens can go there
- Tower CANNOT build on the Island

### Emperor's Choice
